# Task Manager

## Project Overview

## User Stories

### As a busy person, I want to:

1. Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them

```javaScript
test("Submitting a new task adds it to the list", () => {
  // test goes here
});
```

2. Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done

```javaScript
test("Checking an entry marks it as complete", () => {
  // test goes here
});
```

3. Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore

```javaScript
test("Deleting an entry removes it from the list", () => {
  // test goes here
});
```

### As a motor-impaired user, I want to:

1. Use all the features of the app without a mouse

### Stretch

Filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what’s left to do

```javaScript
test("Toggling the filter hides completed tasks from the list", () => {
  // test goes here
});
```

## Functionalities
* Create tasks
* Move tasks between groups
* Delete tasks
* Validate if all existing tasks are completed
* Create, delete, move tasks using only keyboard

## Project Milestones
